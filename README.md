# Time Series Analysis with ARIMA and SARIMAX Models

## Overview
This repository showcases a detailed implementation of time series analysis using ARIMA and SARIMAX models. It includes steps for data preprocessing, decomposition, parameter selection, and forecasting. The project uses the **AirPassengers** dataset, which contains monthly totals of international airline passengers.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and visualizing time series data.
- **Decomposition**: Seasonal and trend decomposition of time series.
- **Modeling**:
  - ARIMA: For non-seasonal time series forecasting.
  - SARIMAX: For seasonal time series with external regressors.
- **Evaluation**: Statistical metrics and visualizations to validate model performance.
